  <h2>🚀 We’re Back, {{name}}!</h2>
  <p>Thanks for being part of the Thriftiffy community! We’ve just completed a major upgrade — and we’re inviting *you* to be among the first to benefit from it.</p>
  
  <p>Here's what’s new:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>📦 New categories: <strong>Electronics</strong> and <strong>Cars</strong> are now supported!</li>
    <li>✨ <strong>2 weeks FREE trial</strong> — no fees, no risk</li>
    <li>🖼️ Upload your own product photos and customize your store</li>
    <li>👤 Add a profile picture to build trust with buyers</li>
    <li>💻 Get advanced features for only <strong>₦2,500/month</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Important:</strong> Due to a recent system update, all previous item listings were lost. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. 🙏</p>

  <p>We’d love to see your store come back even stronger. It takes just a few minutes to re-upload your items — and you’ll be helping bring life back to the marketplace. A full, vibrant store boosts confidence and drives more buyers to your page!</p>
